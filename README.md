# Project Polaris

Nowadays customers are more demanding than ever and customer service has to live up to their expectations. Therefore, several businesses require a more agile way of communicating with their customers to solve their inquiries in a timely manner by offering non-presential assistance with the use of bots, and the capability to connect with a remote advisor using online and mobile integrated messaging, audio, and video experiences.
 
All of this technology is out for grabs but providing ease of integration and customization plus low cost and scale up capabilities is not yet something that has been put together into one solution.
 
Project Polaris aims to allow your business to manage the remote service assistance starting from the moment a customer navigates to your web or mobile application through the one on one interaction between the later and a company representative making business more effective and elevating the quality of experience for your users.

After provisioning your own environment, you can customize your own business rules as to who employee a customer should be contacted with based on what he is looking for and employees workload and availability.

Hook up our capabilities to your existing web and mobile applications and make the most of this cutting edge technology to bring your customer service up to a whole new level.
